#  AI-Powered Smart Supply Chain Management System

> An intelligent Supply Chain Management System built with Python, Flask, and Machine Learning to help businesses forecast demand, optimize inventory, detect anomalies, and improve decision-making through data-driven insights.

##  About the Project

Managing a supply chain efficiently is challenging due to unpredictable customer demand, inventory fluctuations, and operational risks. Businesses often struggle with balancing stock levels while maintaining customer satisfaction and minimizing costs.

This project was developed to address these challenges by combining **data analytics**, **machine learning**, and **interactive visualization** into a single web application. It analyzes historical sales data, provides inventory recommendations, identifies unusual business patterns, and presents meaningful insights through an easy-to-use dashboard.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how AI can support smarter supply chain decisions and improve operational efficiency.

##  What This Project Can Do

-  Analyze historical sales data
-  Forecast future product demand
-  Optimize inventory levels
-  Calculate reorder points
-  Estimate safety stock
-  Detect unusual sales or inventory behavior
-  Simulate supply chain scenarios using a Digital Twin concept
-  Display business insights through interactive dashboards

##  Machine Learning & Analytics

This project combines traditional inventory management techniques with machine learning algorithms to improve business decisions.

### Demand Forecasting
Predicts future demand based on historical sales patterns, helping businesses prepare inventory more effectively.

### Inventory Optimization
Calculates optimal inventory values using:

- Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)
- Safety Stock
- Reorder Point

### Anomaly Detection
Uses machine learning techniques to identify abnormal sales trends and unusual inventory behavior.

### Digital Twin Simulation
Simulates supply chain performance under different business conditions to support planning and decision-making.
